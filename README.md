Mash Up Exercise - Put up on the wall rapid fire style for 5 minutes (or the length of a song) all of the activities that you do (sleep, cook, sex, clean, drive) and online activities (txt, email, Pandora, Facebook, foursquare, online dating). after that time have people break off into 4 person teams and create digital mash up ideas. Pandora connected to a bed to get music for the mood, YouTube app that helps you do makeovers, things like that. Present.

What Would The Headline Say? - Break off into 3-4 teams and have each group write on poster paper what the headlines for the campaign would say. What would the headlines from the industry say? What about from twitter or facebook? What would the NYT write about the campaign? Similar to the reverse press release, it gets us thinking about what kind of impact we want our campaign to have, which is normally really large, epic even. For example, what if a tweet about our campaign read, “I can’t believe a BLANK company just did an ad like that, so awesome!” How cool would it be to get that kind of response from our ad?

Random Image Idea Generation - Give teams of 3-4 people a series of random images from google image printed out. Have those teams use those images as the inspiration to come up with cool executions. (With the pictures of a hot air balloon we came up with a traveling drive-in movie theater that goes to cities with the most likes on their FB page and shows TV shows and Movies. The hot air balloon would be in the shape of a TV set, of course!)

Layering Timeline Exercise - Have teams of 4 break off and create a timeline for a 24hr period in the day in the life of a persona they choose. Have them list the behaviors, tasks, and ideas on stickies underneath the hours of the day. Have them come up with ways that technology can help their particular persona during certain parts of the day. This is similar to something I found on this site: http://adaptivepath.com/ideas/new-ways-of-visualizing-the-customer-journey-map

30 Minute Creative Brief - 4 teams and 4 creative briefs. Read aloud the creative briefs and then have teams grab the one they want. Have them leave and comeback with a campaign and digital solution in 30 minutes (Great practice for BOB). When they come back have them give quick 3 minute presentations of their ideas. Have 3 hats passed out around the class, digital hat, business hat, and big idea hat. At the end of the presentation have each hat talk/be devils advocate for these spaces. Question why they did what they did for the creative brief. (Also a perfect opportunity to teach the Brandcenter clapping rule).

Stickynote Activity - 1 8x11 sheet of paper per person with 6 stickynotes attached on each sheet in 2x3 fashion. Then have people write down one solution/concept/execution for the problem and then pass it to the person to the left of them. Write down another idea until every ones stickies are full.
Then reorganize the stickies on the sheet of paper in front of you with your favorite two ideas on top and share those with the group to start a discussion. Normally you’ll see a pattern emerge and you can use this exercise to generate tons of ideas quickly. Works great with tables and big groups with each table tackling separate ideas.

Longest Sticky Note Chain - Have them put everything away and grab a sticky note pad and get into teams. Give each team 3 mins to brain dump out loud how they would build a sandwich without bread, they have to share with their teams as they write each sticky note. After 3 mins they have 1 minute to find the best idea and one person presents to the whole group. Do this one more time.
Once they’ve released all of their analytical thinking skills give them the simple brief in this format. Because of blank we want to get people to believe blank.
Then give them 20mins and then 5 mins to build a presentation. Give them 25 mins and let them figure out how to split the time.
Format for brief: Given that ______ How can we get _______.

## Creative Exercises

Get Famous:
Do something so cool that the press around and outside of Richmond notices what you did. Bring back full analytics to prove that what you did got the attention of the real world and in the allotted time of the assignment.

Build the best leaf picker-uper:
Using a list of approved items build the best machine for picking up leaves for the ground outside the school. Do it as a solo project and learn how to innovate in a quick amount of time. Points also counted for design and marketing strategy.

The Morse Code Test:
Morse code has been around for almost 200 years, we’ve developed all sorts of ways of carrying the message through wires, light, and sound. It’s your turn. Build a device that carries my message, and do it out of a approved list of parts, the team that carries my message the farthest wins.

Physical World:
Send the Boot Camp on a scavenger hunt in the woods, have them complete tasks and find their way back, in the process have them build together as a team.
